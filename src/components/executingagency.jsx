As the largest and most successful Development Finance Institute (DFI), in the country, BOI is responsible for the coordination and supervision of i-DICE from inception till execution. The selection of BOI as the Executing Agency is based on its experience in implementing and operating similar FGN programs and its credit worthiness with a Long-Term National Rating of AA+ by Fitch (2020).</p>
